# Fawry Rise Journey - Full Stack Internship Challenge

## üí° Challenge Description

This project is a solution to Fawry's Full Stack Development Internship Challenge.  
It implements a simple e-commerce system using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python.

### ‚ú® Features Implemented

- Define products with:
  - `name`, `price`, `quantity`
- Support for:
  - **Expirable Products** (e.g., Cheese, Biscuits)
  - **Shippable Products** (e.g., Cheese, TV)
